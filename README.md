# Sales-Analysis-and-Visualizations-using-Power-BI

## Technology: MS-Excel, MS-PowerBI

In this project, I have analyzed and visualizing sales data for a company using Power BI Desktop.  This dataset includes sales information by product, year, quarter, month, day, country, and segment. 

The project aims to provide insights into sales performance, profit margins, and discounts across different products, regions, and customer segments.

Key Features:

Sales by Product: Analysis of sales revenue by product, including Paseo, VTT, Amarilla, Carretera, Velo, and Montana.

Sales by Region: Breakdown of sales by country, including USA, Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico.

Profit Margin Analysis: Calculation of profit margins by product and month.

Discounts Analysis: Examination of discounts offered by product.

Segment-wise Analysis: Sales and profit analysis by customer segment, including Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, Midmarket, and Small Business.

Visualizations:

Bar charts will display sales by product and region.

Pie charts show the profit margin distribution by product and month.

Stacked charts to illustrate sales and profit by segment.

Tables will provide detailed data on sales, profit, and discounts by product and region.

Insights:

Identification of top-selling products and regions.

Analysis of profit margins and discounts to inform pricing strategies.

Understanding of sales performance by customer segment.

Recommendations for improving sales and profitability.

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI Desktop to analyze and visualize.
